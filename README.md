# misogyny_spanish_ter
In this repository you can find the experiments developed to benchmark mBERT and BETO to identify misogynist tweets, as well as to compare misogyny detection models trained and evaluated on different variations of the Spanish language. These experiments were carried out as a TER (Travail d'Ã©tude et de recherche) project by Galo Castillo at Inria Paris.
